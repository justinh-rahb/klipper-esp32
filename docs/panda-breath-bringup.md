# Panda Breath (ESP32-C3) hardware bring-up report

Date: 2026-07-18. Rig: BIQU Panda Breath board on `/dev/ttyUSB0`, tested by Claude.

## Hardware identified
- Chip: **ESP32-C3** (rev v1.1), 4 MB embedded flash, MAC `ac:eb:e6:8f:e5:1c`.
- Bridge: **CH340** USB-UART (`1a86:USB Serial`); Klipper transport UART0 @ 250000 baud.
- Board auto-resets the MCU on serial port open (normal for UART-bridge ESP32; MCU uptime restarts each host session by design).

## Firmware
- Built from this repo: `./build.sh panda` (ESP-IDF **v5.3.5**). Image `klipper_esp32c3.bin` (177 KB).
- Dictionary validated: **17 commands, 9 responses**; `MCU=esp32c3 CLOCK_FREQ=1000000 SERIAL_BAUD=250000 ADC_MAX=4095`.
- Stock OEM `panda_breath` firmware (WiFi-enabled, ESP-IDF 5.1.4) backed up to `~/panda_breath_stock_backup_acebe68fe51c.bin` (sha256 6f9dd62c…) before flashing.
- New firmware flashed and hash-verified via esptool (CH340 auto-reset; no manual BOOT/RESET).

Independent clock health check: 66 rapid `get_clock` samples over 10 s → **0 monotonic anomalies**, rate ≈ 1 MHz.

## Klippy host connection — full stack runs; clock-sync blocked by CH340/host UART latency
Ran a real Klippy host (venv; `chelper` compiled) in two roles. **GPIO18 never configured** in either.

**Primary role** (ESP32 as `[mcu]`): connects, loads dict, `Configured MCU (1024 moves)`, but the primary clock-sync estimator **diverges** (runaway ~2³² diff after config) → never `Ready`.

**Secondary role** (Klipper Linux host-MCU built as primary `[mcu]`; ESP32 as `[mcu panda]`):
- ✅ Both MCUs connect and configure (`Configured MCU 'mcu'` + `Configured MCU 'panda' (1024 moves)`).
- ✅ Panda clock **frequency syncs correctly** (freq → 1,000,204 Hz, ~0.02% — no divergence, unlike primary role).
- ✅ **Panda ADC data flows to the host** (`analog_in_state` values received for both channels).
- ❌ Still not `Ready`: under continuous traffic the link degrades into a retransmit / `bytes_invalid` storm (`srtt≈70 ms`, `rttvar≈39 ms`, `rto` saturates) and Klippy eventually loses communication.

**Evidence points to the CH340 / host UART path, not firmware.** Ruled out step by step:
- MCU clock proven correct: 71-min rollover soak + 66-sample rapid poll, 0 anomalies.
- **Firmware exonerated by a burst test:** 8 `get_clock`s written back-to-back (0.2 ms) return with all 8 replies bunched within ~5 ms *after* one shared ~78 ms delay — so the delay is a fixed pipeline latency, not per-command firmware work. (FreeRTOS tick 1 kHz, `irq_wait` ≤5 ms, `console_io_task` polls UART every loop.)
- **Measured true RTT over CH340 @ 250 k (`tools/latency_probe.py`, one-byte-first reader): ~80 ms, ~1 ms jitter, unimodal.** An earlier "bimodal 45/90 ms" reading was a packet-reader artifact — the old reader did a fixed `read(256)` under a 50 ms per-read timeout, quantizing the true ~80 ms latency into ~50 ms buckets. The corrected reader (`tools/probe_mcu.py`, buffered-first / one-byte-first) removes that and shows a consistent ~80 ms.
- **Under real Klippy load the link collapses:** `srtt≈70 ms`, `rttvar≈39 ms`, `rto` saturates at 5 s, `receive_seq` stalls, and `bytes_retransmit` / `bytes_invalid` climb steadily until the host declares "Lost communication". The `bytes_invalid` is a *symptom* of the retransmit storm (overlapping/duplicated frames desync the parser), not independent corruption — the ~80 ms RTT exceeds Klipper's clock-sync RTO during the initial handshake, so it retransmits before replies arrive and never converges.
- **Baud is not the cause:** rebuilt and retested at **115200** — RTT unchanged (~79.5 ms) and real Klippy fails identically (`srtt≈71 ms`, same retransmit/`bytes_invalid` storm, never `Ready`). The ~80 ms delay is fixed CH340 buffering, independent of serialization rate, so lowering the baud does not help.
- Ruled out on the host/link side: USB extension cable removed (no change), a different USB port on the same host (no change), a second USB cable (no change), serial `ASYNC_LOW_LATENCY` (no effect; ch341 exposes no `latency_timer`), USB autosuspend (already disabled, device stays active), realtime Linux primary `-r` (no change), lower baud (115200, no change).
- **Not yet isolated:** the CH340 *chip* vs. the host's ch341 driver/USB stack. Ruling that out needs a CH340 loopback, a direct UART capture (logic analyzer on TX/RX), a different bridge chip, or a different host — none of which we have here. So "CH340/host UART path" is as far as the evidence takes us; the ~80 ms is attributable to that path but not yet to the chip alone.

**Architectural constraint:** the panda is locked to CH340 UART — on the C3, native USB Serial/JTAG (low latency, the path the README validated as a Klippy secondary) is on GPIO18/19, and **GPIO18 is the heater relay**. So the panda cannot use native USB.

**Implication for the project:** every Klipper protocol operation works over CH340 UART, but the transport's ~80 ms latency — and its degradation into retransmits / `bytes_invalid` under continuous traffic — prevents Klipper clock-sync from reaching `Ready` in both roles. Getting the panda usable as a live Klipper MCU needs the CH340 link's fixed ~80 ms latency reduced — a CH340 latency-timer / driver fix, a different bridge chip, or a different host (baud was tested and ruled out). Native USB is the clean path but is unavailable on this board (GPIO18 = relay), so the CH340/host UART path remains the next transport problem to solve.

## Not applicable to the panda profile (absent from its 17-command dictionary)
- RMT NeoPixel (dev-profile feature; panda has plain-GPIO LEDs, no addressable LED).
- LEDC hardware PWM / hardware I2C (bentobox-profile features).
- Panda fan is TRIAC phase-angle on GPIO3 (AC) — intentionally never driven in bench testing.
